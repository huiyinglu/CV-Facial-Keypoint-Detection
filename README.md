# CV-Facial-Keypoint-Detection
This project will be all about defining and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces. 

Facial keypoints (also called facial landmarks) are the small magenta dots shown on each of the faces in the image above. In each training and test image, there is a single face and 68 keypoints, with coordinates (x, y), for that face. These keypoints mark important areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc. These keypoints are relevant for a variety of tasks, such as face filters, emotion recognition, pose recognition, and so on. 

This facial keypoints dataset we are using consists of 5770 color images. All of these images are separated into either a training or a test set of data: 3462 of these images are training images, we may use to create a model to predict keypoints and 2308 are test images, which will be used to test the accuracy of our model.
